## ▷ Podcasts

* ⭐ **[The Cyberwire](https://thecyberwire.com/)** - Daily Cybersecurity News. Very timely and informative. They recently added a new CISO Perspectives segment that will be useful to you.
* ⭐ **[Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/)** - Narrative-based podcasts that spend a single or a few episodes to tell the stories about some of the most important or interesting hacks throughout history. Probably not as "useful" as some of the others, but interesting storytelling.
* ⭐ **[Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/)** - Great podcast that contains more business-oriented cybersecurity news and interviews than some of the others.
* [Hacking Humans](https://thecyberwire.com/podcasts/hacking-humans) - Weekly cybersecurity news, from the same people who do the Cyberwire, focuses on social engineering attacks.
* [SANS Internet Storm Center Daily Stormcast](https://isc.sans.edu/podcast.html) - Great 5 minute podcast released daily. High level, quick coverage, but doesn't have the story telling or detail that I usually prefer.
* [Malicious Life](https://malicious.life/) - Like, Darknet Diaries, this is a narrative-based podcasts that spend a single or a few episodes to tell the stories about some of the most important or interesting hacks throughout history. Again, probably not as "useful" as some of the others, but very interesting storytelling.
* [Cyber Motherboard](https://www.vice.com/en/topic/cyber-podcast) - Weekly cybersecurity news and stories from Vice - has some cultural/political leanings, but covers very interesting stories.
